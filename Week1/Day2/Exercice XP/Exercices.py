# values = [10, 20, 30]
# Expected Output:
# {'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}
keys = ["Ten", "Twenty", "Thirty"]
values = [10, 20, 30]

# üåü Exercise 4 : Some Geography
# Goal: Create a function that describes a city and its country.
# Key Python Topics:
# Functions with multiple parameters
# Default parameter values
# String formatting
# Step 1: Define a Function with Parameters
# Define a function named describe_city().
# This function should accept two parameters: city and country.
# Give the country parameter a default value, such as ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù.
def describe_city(city, country="unknown"):
# Step 2: Print a Message
# Inside the function, set up the code to display a sentence like ‚Äú is in ‚Äú.
    print(f"{city} is in {country}")
# Replace <city> and <country> with the parameter values.
# Step 3: Call the Function
# Call the describe_city() function with different city and country combinations.
# Try calling it with and without providing the country argument to see the default value in action.
# Example: describe_city("Reykjavik", "Iceland") and describe_city("Paris").
describe_city("Reykjavik", "Iceland")
describe_city("Paris")
# Expected Output:
# Reykjavik is in Iceland.
# Paris is in Unknown.

# üåü Exercise 5 : Random
# Goal: Create a function that generates random numbers and compares them.
# Key Python Topics:
# random module
# random.randint() function
# Conditional statements (if, else)
# Step 1: Import the random Module
import random
# At the beginning of your script, use import random to access the random number generation functions.
# Step 2: Define a Function with a Parameter
# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 as a parameter.
random_number = random.randint(1,100)
# Step 3: Generate a Random Number
# Inside the function, use random.randint(1, 100) to generate a random integer between 1 and 100.
print(random_number)
# Step 4: Compare the Numbers
# If they are the same, print a success message. Otherwise, print a fail message and display both numbers.
# Step 5: Call the Function
# Call the function with a number between 1 and 100.
# Expected Output:
# Success! (if the numbers match)
# Fail! Your number: 50, Random number: 23 (if they don't match)
def int_accept(number):
    if 1 < number <=100:
        random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
        if number == random_number:
            print("Sucess!")
        else:

# üåü Exercise 6 : Let‚Äôs create some personalized shirts !
# Goal: Create a function to describe a shirt‚Äôs size and message, with default values.
# Key Python Topics:
# Functions with parameters and default values
# Keyword arguments
# Step 1: Define a Function with Parameters
# Define a function called make_shirt().
# This function should accept two parameters: size and text.
def make_shirt(size="large",text="I love Python"):
    print(f"the shirt size is {size} and {text}")
# Step 2: Print a Summary Message
# Set up the function to display a sentence summarizing the shirt‚Äôs size and message.
# Step 3: Call the Function
make_shirt("XXXL","oups !")
print(make_shirt)
# Step 4: Modify the Function with Default Values
# Modify the make_shirt() function so that size has a default value of ‚Äúlarge‚Äù and text has a default value of ‚ÄúI love Python‚Äù.

# Step 5: Call the Function with Default and Custom Values
# Call make_shirt() to make a large shirt with the default message.
make_shirt()
# Call make_shirt() to make a medium shirt with the default message.
make_shirt("medium")
# Call make_shirt() to make a shirt of any size with a different message.
make_shirt("XL","are you sure of your size ?")
# Step 6 (Bonus): Keyword Arguments
# Call make_shirt() using keyword arguments (e.g., make_shirt(size="small", text="Hello!")).
# Expected Output:
# The size of the shirt is large and the text is I love Python.
# The size of the shirt is medium and the text is I love Python.
# The size of the shirt is small and the text is Custom message.

# üåü Exercise 7 : Temperature Advice
# Goal: Generate a random temperature and provide advice based on the temperature range.
# Key Python Topics:
# Functions
# Conditionals (if / elif)
# Random numbers
# Floating-point numbers (Bonus)
# Handling seasons (Bonus)
# Step 1: Create the get_random_temp() Function
import random
# Create a function called get_random_temp() that returns a random integer between -10 and 40 degrees Celsius.
def get_random_temp(season):
    if season == "Winter":
        temperature = -2
    elif season == "Spring":
        temperature = 15
    elif season == "Summer":
        temperature = 35
    elif season == "Autumn":
        temperature = 22
    return temperature
# Step 2: Create the main() Function
# Create a function called main(). Inside this function:
def main(season):
    random_temp = get_random_temp(season)
    print(f"The temperature right now is {random_temp} degrees Celsius.")
    if random_temp < 0:
        print("Brrr, that‚Äôs freezing! Wear some extra layers today.")
    elif random_temp >=0 and random_temp <= 16:
        print("Quite chilly! Don't forget your coat")
    elif 16 <= random_temp <= 23:
        print("Nice weather.")
    elif 24 <= random_temp <= 32:
        print("A bit warm, stay hydrated,")
    elif 32 <= random_temp <= 40:
        print("It's really hot! Stay cool.")
main("Winter")
# Call get_random_temp() to get a random temperature.
# Store the temperature in a variable and print a friendly message like:
# ‚ÄúThe temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.‚Äù
# Step 3: Provide Temperature-Based Advice
# Inside main(), provide advice based on the temperature:
# Below 0¬∞C: e.g., ‚ÄúBrrr, that‚Äôs freezing! Wear some extra layers today.‚Äù
# Between 0¬∞C and 16¬∞C: e.g., ‚ÄúQuite chilly! Don‚Äôt forget your coat.‚Äù
# Between 16¬∞C and 23¬∞C: e.g., ‚ÄúNice weather.‚Äù
# Between 24¬∞C and 32¬∞C: e.g., ‚ÄúA bit warm, stay hydrated.‚Äù
# Between 32¬∞C and 40¬∞C: e.g., ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hot! Stay cool.‚Äù
# Step 4: Floating-Point Temperatures (Bonus)
# Modify get_random_temp() to return a random floating-point number using random.uniform() for more accurate temperature values.
# Step 5: Month-Based Seasons (Bonus)
# Instead of directly generating a random temperature, ask the user for a month (1-12) and determine the season using if/elif conditions.
# Modify get_random_temp() to return temperatures specific to each season.
# Expected Output:
# The temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.
# It's really hot! Stay cool.

month_input = int(input("Choose a month between 1 and 12"))

season_list = ["Winter","Winter","Spring","Spring","Spring","Summer","Summer","Summer","Autumn","Autumn","Autumn","Winter"]
